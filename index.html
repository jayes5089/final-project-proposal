        <h1>FINAL PROJECT PROPOSAL</h1>
        <h2>STONKlistUS: Project Webapp Concept by Jason Yescas</h2>

        <h3>What is the name of this project?</h3>
        <p>STONKlistUS. I wanted this name to not conflict 
        with any other website or service. And since I can really make it my own,
        why not have a bit of fun with the name?</p>

        <h3>Are you a part of a team?</h3>
        <p>I am a part of the ScrumTeam FatDoinks, but this is solely the 
        project of Jason Yescas. All of the other FatDoinks members have their own projects.</p>

        <h3>What is the main purpose of this project?</h3>
        <p>I want this web application to list every US based live stock price and hopefully
        give an accurate prediction on what stocks will go up or down. I understand it may be
        restricting myself and the app to only focus on US based stocks and not even cryptocurrency,
        but this is something I am going to be testing out first before I try and implement foreign stocks
        and cryptocurrency.</p>

        <h3>What technologies will this web application utilize?</h3>
        <p>At this point in time, I am still not 100% for everything this will use, I am sure it will
        be hosted on Microsoft Azure and utilize some kind of deeplearning AI. I need to figure out which 
        programming language would be best for making having the prices for the stocks updated on the spot And
        how I would implement an opensource and free AI to make predictions and have them be understandable.</p>

        <h3>What are your main priorities when you begin making this project?</h3>
        <p>For starters, I need to make the list of stocks and their live prices as well as previous prices
        I may be able to take a note out of another trading app's book like Robinhood or Fidelity,
        but I want to make it clear that this app is not intented for trades, it is solely to find out the prices
        of stocks and give predictions.</p>

        <h3>What are you less likely to be focused on with your web application.</h3>
        <p>As much as I would like to make it look visually appealing or have it be so organized/userfriendly
        that you could teach a child to become a day-trader using my web app; it will have to be set aside atleast
        within the beginning stages of the application. In short, it's going to look kind of ugly and cluttered.
        But besides that, foreign stocks and cryptocurrency are a no-go too unless I know for certain that the webapp
        is capable of handling the US list of stocks and provide atleast a somewhat decent prediction in the changes of
        prices.</p>

        <h3>What technical features that you've learned in class will be put into this web applicaion?</h3>
        <p>Possibly HTML and Python, but this is still something I am completely unsure of. As soon as I get to Lewis on
        3/28, I am going to be looking up everything I possibly need to know and things I need to learn going into starting
        this project because I REALLY want to make this happen and do it how I envision it.</p>
        
        <h3>What technical feature that you didn't learn in class will be put into this web application?</h3>
        <p>A lot. I would answer this question if I knew how much work needs to be done, but in all honesty I still need to do this.</p>
